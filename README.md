# Project Overview
Final project for CSC-455: Databases.
Contributors: Aaron Schwartz, George Bohorquez, Bella Novicki, and Max Groover.
Our project is a SQL database to keep track of video games owned by different users. We also have several queries to demonstrate front-end querying capabilities using simple PHP.
