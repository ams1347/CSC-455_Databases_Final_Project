	<h3>Each of the following links demonstrates a different database query:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="query1.php">Query 1: Displays platform name, platform model, and manufacturer for each platform/model  (demonstrates two-table join)</a>
		<li><a href="query2.php">Query 2: Displays all games, release dates, game developers, and game publishers (demonstrates three-table join)</a>
		<li><a href="query3.php">Query 3: Displays all publishers and their parent companies, only for publishers that have parent companies (demonstrates self-join)</a>
		<li><a href="query4.php">Query 4: Counts number of publishers in database (demonstrates aggregate function)</a>
		<li><a href="query5.php">Query 5: Displays each user ID alongside the count of how many games they own, for owners of more than 3 games (demonstrates aggregate function using GROUP BY and HAVING)</a>
		<li><a href="query6.php">Query 6: Displays all models of all PlayStations (demonstrates text-based search query using LIKE with wildcard(s))</a>
		<li><a href="query7.php">Query 7: Displays game title and genre for all games with more than 2 genres (demonstrates subquery)</a>
		<li><a href="query8.php">Query 8: Displays all games alongside how many copies the game has sold (based on tracked users) (demonstrates stored function)</a>
		<li><a href="query9_input.html">Query 9: Takes an input of manufacturer (i.e. Sony, Microsoft), and returns how many consoles they've manufactured (demonstrates stored procedure)</a>
		<li><a href="query10.php">Query 10: If you try to add a platform and the release date is after 2022, it automatically sets that to be 2021 (demonstrates trigger)</a>
